# Single User Relational Database written in Python 3

## Surly requires Python 3.6 and Pandas

If you don't already have Python 3.6 installed, I highly recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution.

Anaconda comes with the conda package manager that can be used to install pandas
`conda install pandas`

If not using Anaconda, pandas can be installed using pip:
`pip install pandas`

After the requirements are met, navigate to the root of the project and run `python readin.py`. This will read in the test file and display the output in the console.
