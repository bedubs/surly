Organizational Hierarchy to help break down the task
(Taken from class notes)

SurlyDB
	-Database, represented as a collection of relations (tables)
		-Relations, a collection of tuples (rows)
			-Tuples, composed of attributes (columns)
				-Attributes, data values

	-Schema, descriptor; metadata

Need a class for each level of the hierarchy
Need a main method to handle input and output
Parse requests/commands?
